# TSdownloader
## Download the segmented mpeg video (.m3u8/.ts) from streaming websites
1. Make sure you have "requests" installed:
```    
       pip install requests
       pip install -U requests[security] 
```

2. Specify the urls in the .py file

3. Run:
```    python tsdownload.py destination ```

  
__p.s. There're probably better, more robust tools out there. This was meant to be a quick and dirty oneoff disposable script__ 🐒
